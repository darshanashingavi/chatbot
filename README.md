# JavaScript Chatbot 

This is a simple and responsive chatbot built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features an interactive user interface where users can type messages and receive automated responses. The project demonstrates basic DOM manipulation, styling, and chatbot logic. It can be easily customized or extended to connect with AI APIs like OpenAI or Gemini for smarter responses.

I hope it makes a good intro for anyone interested in chatbots and frontend fundamentals.

Enjoy!
